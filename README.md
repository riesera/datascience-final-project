# datascience-final-project
Two models are used for fatal car crash predictions based on the Fatality Analyst Reporting System Auxiliary Dataset (FARS Auxiliary).

All code and data analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook. This project was done for my datascience final project, at the University of St. Thomas during the Fall 2022 semester. The repository was created by my teacher, Dr. Carlos Monroy and is private. This is a download of the final Jupyter Notebook from that repository and a repost for skill demonstration purposes. I did this in collaboration with my classmate, Jennifer Rodriguez. All sections marked JR were done by her, and sections marked AR were done by me.
